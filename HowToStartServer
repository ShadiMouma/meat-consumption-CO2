// 1 open Terminal and write npm i
// 2 write npm run build:prod
// 3 npm run build
// 4 npm run server


// Explanation
The server runs on Node.js, the file ./server/server.ts is where we have our backend server routes
and from where we can call and get data back.

server.ts is being bundled by webpack , the configs are in webpack.server.config.js

// Front end
app.js in the main file that imorts all our needed scripts on the front end and all our styles (scss)
webpack bundles everything together and builds the public folder where we will have our end compressed minified results.

app.js bundling configs are in ./webpack.config.js
